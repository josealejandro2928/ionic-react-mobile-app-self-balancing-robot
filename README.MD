# ionic-react-mobile-app-self-balancing-robot
This is a project in which we built a mobile application to control a custom self-balancing robot through a Bluetooth HC-08 interface. The project allows sending commands to the Arduino micro controller to perform tasks such as:

1. Movement in the 4 directions: Forward, Backward, Right and Left through a joystick interface.
2. Getting all the measurements from the robot sensors to represent the robot status in tables and graphs.
3. Change the PID controllers constants, and the maximum robots speeds.
4. Draw the map of the robot in a canvas given the measurements.
